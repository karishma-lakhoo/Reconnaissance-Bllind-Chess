# Reconnaissance Blind Chess Agents

This repository contains two agents for playing Reconnaissance Blind Chess, a variant with limited visibility:

1. **Baseline Agent:** Utilizes state-space reduction, strategic move selection, and random sensing.
2. **Improved Agent:** Enhances the Baseline Agent by incorporating heuristic sensing strategies, such as prioritizing sensing near the opponent's king and pieces, and sensing on captured square locations.
